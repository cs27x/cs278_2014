# In-class Assignment 3

## Overview

In this assignment, you will practice writing requirements. Writing a clear requirement
specification is one of the most difficult challenges in software engineering. It is almost
inevitable that requirements are misunderstood and that wrong assumptions are made.

You should have read the outside reading on user stories by last week. The user story
reading is listed on the website: https://vanderbilt.coursera.org/cs278-001/wiki/Describing_Requirements_with_User_Stories

## Key Information

Released: 9-9-14

Due Date: 9-9-14

Close Time: 12:25

Total Groups: 6

Requires Group Completion: Yes


## Part 1 - Specification Design

You will have exactly 30mins to complete Part 1. Please make sure that you are done on-time.

As a team, you should decide on an application that you would like to have and would be
useful to Vanderbilt students, college students in general, or people living in Nashville.
You must then write a specification for the application and deliver the specification as
a set of user stories. Each user story must be something that would impact the end-user 
(e.g., no implementation style user stories). You will be graded on how completely you
describe the application. The user stories should be written on the notecards provided
to you in class. Each user story should be written down in duplicate on 2 cards. Each 
use story should also be numbered and have the team number on it.

For each user story, you must create an "acceptance criteria" or method for evaluating if
the user story is satisfied by an implementation of the specification. Your acceptance
criteria should be "testable" by a person on another team. Your acceptance criteria
should be written down on one copy of each user story.

## Part 2 - Estimation

You will have exactly 10mins to complete Part 2.

As a team, you need to play the requirements poker game.

1. Each team member should take 5 note cards and create a set of cards labeled with the numbers
1-5 (e.g., a card with "5" on it, a card with "3" on it, etc.). 

2. Each team member should hold these cards like you are playing Poker. 
 
3. A moderator should read each user story that you wrote and then each team member
should place the card representing how difficult they think the story is (on a scale of 1-5) 
face down on the table. 

4. When everyone has put their card down, the moderator should ask that they be turned over. 

5. If the estimates are not the same, the highest and lowest estimate should each provide 
a summary of why they chose their estimates and then entire team should repeat steps 4-5 until the team 
converges on the same estimate.

6. When an estimate is unanimously chosen by the team, it should be written down on the
EXACTLY ONE COPY of the card that has the acceptance criteria written on it. These estimated 
user stories should be kept separate.

7. Repeat 3-6 until all of the user stories are estimated.

## Part 3 - Implementation

You will have exactly 30min to complete this part.

Using sheets of paper provided to you, you must create a paper prototype of another team's
application. Choose another team and exchange user stories with them. __You should not give
the other team your estimated copy of the stories__.

As you build your paper prototype, you should keep track of how difficult it was to make
decisions on the user stories. On a separate notecard, write down a list of the user
story numbers and how difficult you thought that they were. If a user story is unclear,
create a separate notecard, duplicate the user story, and then write down why the user
story was unclear on the back.

At the end of this exercise,
you should have a complete paper mockup of the user stories provided to you by the other
team. Make sure that each page of your paper prototype has your team number and the
team number that you were implementing the user stories for (e.g., Team X:... Implementing
Team Y).

__At the end of class, hand-in the user stories, paper prototypes, estimate cards, and
any unclear user story cards. Include a separate "cover card" that lists your team number
and the members in your group.__

## Part 4 - Implementation

You have been assigned to implement the user stories and paper prototype provided to you as 
your first out of class assignment. Please use the following form to evaluate the design,
grading criteria, and effort estimations that have been provided to you:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wq-6JWAz8SdTZQ82zUfMPJxSCTXErh4quR8GR36HfOk/viewform?usp=send_form

You have 50min to complete the review of the other team's design. At the end of the 50min,
the teams will have 20min to discuss their evaluations with each other and seek clarification
on important issues. Make sure that you do a thorough job of completing the above form
as this will be the basis for the instructor's assessment of the complexity and clarity
of the assignment and hence determine when you get started and how long you have.
