# Final Build Cycle / Project Requirements

## Overview

A key part of most software release cycles is a beta test with target users.
Beta tests help to uncover critical flaws in software implementation or design
through interaction with real users. The goal of the final build cycle will have
a beta release of your application ready.

## Part 1 - Define the User Stories for the Beta

You must define and commit to a set of user stories that will be included in the
beta release. In the README file for your project, you should create a "Beta
Release" section that includes all of the user stories that will be complete for
the beta. You should make sure that your user stories define a functioning minimum
viable product. The user stories should be presented in a numbered list with an 
acceptance criteria underneath each one in the following format:

  1. __Story__: As a student at Vanderbilt, I want to be able to see a list of textbooks available
     for purchase from other students so that I can save money. 
  
    __Acceptance__: 
    - The list of textbooks is updated whenever a new one is offered for sale
    - Each textbook includes the class that it is required for
    - There is a button to contact the seller through some format, such as email 
    - The list of textbooks is fetched at least once a day from the server that stores
      the master list
      
Complete the list of user stories that your team will commit to have completed for the 
beta. You will be graded on how well you scope these stories and whether or not they are
completed. When you are done, ask the instructor for approval of the list.

## Part 2 - The Beta on the Last Day of Class

On the last day of class, you should be prepared to distribute the beta to everyone
in the class. Part of the grade for the final project will be based on whether or
not 75% or more of the other people in the class can verify that the user stories
above meet the acceptance criteria. You should plan a process that takes no more than
5 minutes for distributing your beta in class or in advance of class to the other 
classmates.
